""" DESCRIPTION:
    Write a program that asks the user to enter three numbers: start, stop, and step.
    Create a range object using these values and convert it to a list named 'numbers'.

    Write a program that asks the user to enter a list of numbers separated by spaces.
    Then, ask for two indices 'start' and 'end' to slice the list.
    Create a new list 'sliced_list' containing elements from 'start' to 'end' (excluding 'end').

    TIP: Use list slicing syntax list[start:end] to extract a sublist.

    Write a program that asks the user to enter a word and then checks if the word is a palindrome.
